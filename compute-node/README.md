# Haluk Node

Welcome to the **Haluk Node** repository! By running a Haluk Node, you become part of a decentralized network that provides GPU resources for ComfyUI workflows—especially text-to-video tasks. This README outlines how to set up, manage, and maintain a Haluk Node in the network.

## Introduction

**Haluk** is a decentralized platform enabling GPU owners to share their resources with developers who require robust compute for AI workflows, particularly those built using ComfyUI. Node Providers earn **$HALUK** tokens for maintaining high uptime and performance, with on-chain mechanisms ensuring transparent rewards.

---

## High-Level Architecture

- **Node Providers**: Contribute GPU resources, install the Haluk plugin, and connect to the Haluk network.
- **Dashboard**: A web-based platform (front-end) where users deploy, manage, and monitor AI workflows built on ComfyUI.
- **On-Chain Incentives**: Node Providers receive $HALUK tokens for fulfilling compute tasks according to performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### For Node Providers

If you have GPU-equipped machines and want to participate in Haluk’s decentralized network, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment**  
   - Ensure your system meets the hardware and software prerequisites (NVIDIA GPUs, Docker, etc.).
   - Clone the Haluk Node repository (or install via the provided binary/package).

2. **Install & Configure**  
   - Follow the [Node Setup Guide](neurons/miners/README.md) for detailed instructions.  
   - Register your node on the Haluk Dashboard (or CLI) to connect on-chain.

3. **Monitor Performance**  
   - Your node’s reputation is updated based on SLA compliance, throughput, and reliability.
   - Regularly check logs and metrics to ensure optimal GPU performance.

4. **Earn $HALUK**  
   - For every successful task processed, you earn $HALUK. Nodes with high reputation enjoy priority for new workloads and higher potential rewards.
